Examples
========

SoLoud package comes with a few simple examples. These can be found under the 'demos' directory. Pre-built binaries for Windows can also be found in the 'bin' directory.

Along with the examples, the 'bin' directory also contains some command-line tools. These are safe to run without parameters, and will print out help when run.

simplest
--------

.

The simplest example initializes SoLoud, and uses the speech synthesizer to play some sound. Once the sound has finished, the application cleans up and quits.

This example also uses SoLoud's cross-platform thread library to sleep while waiting for the sound to end.

welcome
-------

.

Slightly more complicated console-based example, playing different kinds of sounds.

multimusic
----------

.

The multimusic example loads two OGG music loops as well as sound effects. Use mouse to interact with the GUI to fade between songs, fade replay speed of the songs and to trigger sound effects.

piano
-----

.

This example is a simple implementation of a playable instrument. The example also includes a simple waveform generator (soloud_basicwave.cpp/h), which can produce square, saw, sine and triangle waves. If compiled to use portmidi, you can also use an external midi keyboard to drive the example.

Key(s)   Effect
-------- --------
1234..   Play notes ("black keys")
qwer..   Play notes ("white keys")

Speech synthesizer and on-screen text describe what different keys do when pressed. You can also adjust
some filters and pick waveforms using the GUI.

mixbusses
---------

.

The mixbusses example demonstrates the use of mixing busses. You can use the GUI to adjust volume of different busses.

env
---

.

The env demo is a non-interactive demo of how SoLoud could be used to play environmental audio.

pewpew
------

.

The pewpew demo demonstrates the use of the playClocked commands. Use the GUI buttons to trigger either single sound effect or repeated sound effect via play() and playClocked() calls.

To exaggarate the effect a bit, the demo requests a very large audio buffer from SoLoud. The difference between the play and playClocked effects is that with play(), all sounds triggered between audio buffers begin playing from the start of the next audio buffer, while playClocked spreads the sounds across the audio buffer, making the sounds more separate.

space
-----

.

The space demo is a non-interactive demo showing visualization data captured from different parts of the audio pipeline. The
scope displays the data only from the speech synth while the FFT data only uses the music as input.

3dtest
-------
![3dtest demo screenshot](images/demo_3dtest)
.

Simple 3d audio test. One audio source orbits the listener, another goes on a crazy orbit, and third audio source is where the mouse pointer is. The view is from above, with the listener looking at the top of the screen.

monotone
--------
![monotone demo screenshot](images/demo_monotone)
.

This demo plays a MONOTONE song and lets you play with some filters on it.

tedsid
------
![tedsid demo screenshot](images/demo_tedsid)
.

This demo plays a SID song and a TED song, and lets you play with some filters as well as fade the volume of the two songs.
