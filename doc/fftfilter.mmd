SoLoud::FFTFilter
=================

The FFT filter is a short-time fourier transform filter which can
be used as basis for FFT-based effects. The base implementation
does a simple tone downshifting.

The filter exists mainly to adjust the speech synthesizer's voice in
strange ways. It can also be used as basis for other FFT-based filters.

The filter does not support changing of parameters on the fly, nor does
it take changing of relative play speed into account.
